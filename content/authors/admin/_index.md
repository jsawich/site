Hi, I am a researcher and PhD student at the [Leibniz University Hannover](https://www.mak.uni-hannover.de/en/wichert). My research lies at the intersection between development and environmental economics. I work with large and unique datasets using up-to-date econometric methods to develop interesting insights that have important policy implications. 

I visited [UC San Diego](https://gps.ucsd.edu/) for an academic research stay in 2021-22. 

In 2024/25, I will be on the academic job market.
