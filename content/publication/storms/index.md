abstract: This paper investigates how much bilateral trade is affected by temporary disruptions of shipping networks caused by storms. Specifically, we examine how much trade is directed to other shipping routes or does not take place at all. We unpack the aggregate impact of oceanic cyclones by examining transportation volume and freight rates by a major container ship company. In event-studies nested in a gravity-style equation, we find that a cyclone reduces trade by 2% between countries across all modes of transport, while this effect doubles for affected port-pairs. After a storm, shipping firms increase freight rates on affected routes amplifying the trading impact. Neighboring port pairs step in as substitutes for industrially relevant goods such as machinery, electrical and intermediate materials. Data on geo-located ship voyages show that following a storm, ships travel at slower speed incurring delay by up to 30 hours depending on the shipping company.
